## Recap of our third meeting this semester!
0. Lots of cookies!
1. Karen went through fitting lines and curves to data in 2D using scipy and numpy functions.
2. In rapid pace, Karen talked about Principle Component Analysis (PCA), going through the math in numpy before mentioning the built-in PCA of matplotlib. Most material was taken from [this wonderful blog](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_pca_step_by_step.html#using-the-pca-class-from-the-matplotlibmlab-library).
4. Emily showed her recent work on using classes to handle the datasets from different birds! We might have a follow-up meeting on using classes as many advantages were mentioned, but the time didn't allow us to go into detail.

We ran out of time! So the timestamp discussion led by Chinmay will be postponed to next week together with more examples on data visualization! Stay tuned on the website.
