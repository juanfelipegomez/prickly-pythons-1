## Recap of our fifth meeting this semester! 
### Topic: Geographic Information System (GIS)
0. Coconut buns from [Happy Buns](http://goodfoodfinderaz.com/find-good-food/happy-buns-asian-bakery/), delicious coffee, pralines and chocolate!
1. Karen introduced the Prickly Python group to our guest speakers Matt, Jill and Xi from ASU Library's Map and Geospatial Hub. Karen also reminded everyone to vote for our supplier of coconut buns for the [Rising Phoneix Award](https://azasianchamber.com/rising-phoenix-award-vote/).
2. Matt, Jill and Xi gave a broad and illuminating presentation about GIS, going through the basic definitions and giving examples such as an extruded 3D model of buildings around ASU's Tempe campus. Matt showed further instances of GIS visualizations from his work in Miami Geographic, sheding light on things like the demography and the locations of bicycle/pedestrian accidents in Miami. 
Matt also went through some fundamental geometric operations for extracting information from maps.

3. Joe talked about a bunch of things related to maps and geographic data:


- Bus bunching - If a bus gets delayed, the likelihood that it needs to pick up more passengers at the next bus stop increases because there is more time for passengers to accumulate. This means that the dealyed bus has to pick up more people and so gets delayed even further. The effect snowballs until the trailing bus (mostly empty) catches up with the delayed bus (filled with people). 
- [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow#Cholera) - physician, and one of the first data scientist, plotted cases from an outbreak of cholera in London in 1854 on a map and saw that they are all centred around one pump in the Soho district. Further investigative work confirmed that the disease was indeed being spread through drinking water - thanks to the guiding visualization provided by maps.
- Africa is larger than Greenland (30,370,000km^2 vs 2,166,086km^2) but the two landmasses look very similar in size on maps drawn with the Mercator projection since in that projective geometry area is not conserved and gets stretched out towards the poles. See also this interesting blog entry about the [true size of Africa](http://kai.sub.blue/en/africa.html).
- One solution to get around the distortions and limitations of a 2D map is to go to 3D, Ã  la Star Wars. See this [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25176) for one way forward in this direction.
