## Recap of our fourth meeting this semester!
0. Coconut buns from [Happy Buns](http://goodfoodfinderaz.com/find-good-food/happy-buns-asian-bakery/), delicious coffee, pralines and chocolate from New Orleans!
1. Karen and Joe reminded everyone about the tenth [.Astronomy conference](https://www.dotastronomy.com) being held in Baltimore this year.
2. Joe talked about how the bird pie figure inspired by Emily's project was made. It required some tinkering to get the pie charts and pointers to line up neatly but the end result was worth it. A 3D iso-value surface plot was then made to visualize a protein molecule where the atoms are simulated as a collection of 3D Gaussians. A animation function was then employed to transform a static 2D image into a dynamic 1D one, giving viewers the sense of time. Finally, we showed a work-in-progress example of modelling the flocking/murmuration behaviours of birds and fishes. 
3. Python pointers include:
- Put `%matplotlib notebook` as opposed to `%matplotlib inline` if you want to enable interactive plotting in a Jupyter notebook.
- ax.legend() function will produce a legend.
- np.meshgrid() outputs numpy arrays containing orthogonal coordinate values for easy evaluation.
Easiest way to learn is to read the documentations, grab an example, and start playing around with it.
4. Please visit our [homepage](http://prickly-pythons.github.io) where you can find topics for future meetings and links to the codes presented.
